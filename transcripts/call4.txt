Agent: Good afternoon, you’ve reached HomeSecure. How may I assist you?
Customer: I’m not sure if my alarm is working. It keeps beeping for no reason.
Agent: That could be a low battery or a sensor error. Can I get your account number?
Customer: Hold on... okay, it’s 45892.
Agent: Got it. I’ll guide you through a quick reset. Let’s start by opening the panel.
Customer: Okay, I see the panel.
Agent: Great. Now press and hold the reset button...
